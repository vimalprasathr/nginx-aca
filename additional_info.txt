- 'db_<trackerid>' table contains the real time data captured every few seconds about the vehicles and consists of the following column names:
time DATETIME for capturing the timestamp in which the vehicle has travelled(when user asks data for a given date/duration, use this column),
latitude DECIMAL for latitude coordinate of the vehicle,
longitude DECIMAL for longitude coordinate of the vehicle,
speed SMALLINT for speed of the vehicle,
course SMALLINT for direction in which the vehicle is moving,
distance DECIMAL for distance traveled by the vehicle,
stationary TINYINT for indicating whether the vehicle is stationary or moving,
received_datetime VARCHAR for timestamp when the data was received,
attributes VARCHAR for additional attributes of the position,
network VARCHAR for network details,
harsh_breaking FLOAT for indicating harsh braking events,
acceleration FLOAT for indicating acceleration events.

- 'db_<trackerid>_status' table contains the real time data captured every few seconds about the status of the hardware and consists of the following column names:
status_info_time DATETIME for timestamp of the status information,
fortification_state TINYINT for indicating the state of fortification,
acc_state TINYINT for indicating the state of the accelerator,
rx_pwr_state TINYINT for indicating the state of the power receiver,
hw_condition SMALLINT for indicating the hardware condition,
gps_pos_avail TINYINT for indicating whether GPS position is available,
fuel_cut_off TINYINT for indicating whether fuel is cut off,
voltage_state SMALLINT for indicating the state of the voltage,
gsm_signal_level SMALLINT for indicating the level of GSM signal.

- Please note: When querying the tracking data for vehicles, use the table name retrieved from the 'db_name' column in the 'trackers' table to access the relevant table that contains time, date, distance, speed, and other tracking details.
columns db_name and db_status_name in trackers table contains the reference table names.
For SPEED and DISTANCE use columns from db_<trackerid> dynamic table.
example: db_359593080115463 and db_359593080115463_status, where 359593080115463 is the tracker/vehicle id.
db_359593080115463 and db_359593080115463_status contains the realtime data, refer the below table details of db_<trackerid> and db_<trackerid>_status.
<trackerid> is the PLACEHOLDER for `id` of the trackers table and always replace the <trackerid> with the actual `id` (primary key) from the trackers table.
STRICTLY do not include the column 'id' in the query for the 'db_<trackerid>' and 'db_<trackerid>_status' tables as it is not available.
The dynamic 'db_<trackerid>' table does not have a direct relationship with other tables, and there is no 'id' column in this table. When joining the 'db_<trackerid>' table with other tables, use the syntax 'JOIN db_<trackerid> d ON t.db_name = 'db_<trackerid>'', where 't' refers to the 'trackers' table. Do not attempt to join the 'db_<trackerid>' table with other tables using a non-existent column or relationship.
Use only the columns that are present in these tables. Given below is the dynamic table details for this user:
